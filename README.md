# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

It is a project that has been forked from Lighthouse Labs with the intent to develop HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills.

A few features have been implimented to display a character count while writting new tweets, display error messages if the maxium character limit has been reacher or if the user is submitting a tweet with no content. 
Additionally a few simple animations have been added to the new tweet button as well as the new tweet area.
